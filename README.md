Configure Users<br />

- Step 1<br />
Take note of the panel listed in the top right.  If it says "Agent Panel," then you are in the "Admin Panel" and vice versa.  You need to be in the "Agent Panel" for this one.  Click on "Users" then "Add User."

- Step 2<br />
Fill out the information accordingly with First and Last Name, Email Address, etc.  Now click on "Add User."<br />
*Note: Make sure to add a contact phone number.  I did not in this example for obvious reasons.*

  *Note: If you uncheck "Send account activation email" you can to set the password manually.  Since my agent doesn't have an actual email address, this is what I had to do.  A new checkbox option will then appear saying "Require password change at next login."*

- Step 5<br />
Finish by clicking "Create Account."
